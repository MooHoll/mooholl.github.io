<h2>Masters by Research</h2>

If you're unsure about doing a PhD or need more experience in order to win a funded PhD studentship, an MSc by Research can be a good choice. These are usually 1yr full-time (2yrs part-time) 100% research degrees where you write up a thesis at the end (like a mini-PhD). These usually aren't advertised on University websites but we can make them happen. Send me an email if you're interested in this option. 


<h2>Funded Undergraduate Summer Placement</h2>

Funded summer placements for UK students usually between their 2nd and 3rd years of study. Please note, I do not take on voluntary/unpaid projects as this is an unfair advantage over those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who need to work.

[The Genetics Society](https://genetics.org.uk/grants/summer-studentships/) - deadline March.

[FSBI](https://fsbi.org.uk/internships/) - deadline March.

<!---[MIBTP](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/mibtp/rep/) - deadline June.\ -->
<!---[CENTA](https://centa.ac.uk/centa-research-experience-placements-rep-2022/) - deadline usually around May.-->

If you would be interested in carrying out a summer project in the lab please try to contact me at least one month before the deadline of the funding you're interested in.

<h2>Undergraduate and Masters Projects</h2>

I can host current University of Leicester students for final year undergraduate projects and for masters projects.
