In addition to the core lab, we associate with a few larger groupings within the department and University; the Neurogenetics Group, the Applied Population Genomics Group and the Centre for Environmental Health and Sustainability. These groups provide a rich intellectual and social environment, with weekly seminars from group members and an annual retreat somewhere scenic.
